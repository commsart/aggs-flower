in no particular order:
- allow for aggregations names discovery and multiple buckets. Currently hardcoded for default "2" and "3s"
- opposite scaling - scale nodes while keeping svg constant
- collision detection for nodes, make sure that nodes do not overlap
- update the data bind to the simulation rather than redrawing entire svg. Hopefully new nodes/links will pop out with new data...

others:
- different node and links coloring
- more information displayed on the links (data, text...)
