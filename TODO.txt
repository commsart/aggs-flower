in no particular order:
- allow for aggregations names discovery and multiple buckets. Currently hardcoded for default "2" and "3s"
- cleanup parameters; good auto scaling
- design good auto scaling for svg size / given node size. Best would be to calculate the nodes (circles) 
	distribution density around the edges of the graph and adjust the size accordingly
- opposite scaling - scale nodes while keeping svg constant
- collision detection for nodes, make sure that nodes do not overlap
- what would be required to make it 3D?
- update the data bind to the simulation rather than redrawing entire svg. Hopefully new nodes/links will pop out with new data...

others:
- different node and links coloring
- more information displayed on the links (data, text...)
